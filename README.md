<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Challenge 20 involves creating a work portfolio of my software development projects. So far, three projects are included but I am excited to add more in the future!</p> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install react, react-dom, react-icons, and react-scripts. Web-vitals package is avaialble for install as well, however, I was not able to incorporate its functionality into this project.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>
<p>Fist, install all node packages by entering 'npm install' into the command line. The application must then be built using 'npm run build', followed by npm run start to launch the app.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>Feel free to message me if you have any ideas on how to make this better!</p>
